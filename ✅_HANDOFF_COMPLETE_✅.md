That file will guide you through everything step-by-step.

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION (In Plain English)

**The Problem:**
- Your APK showed: "Notifications not supported on this device"
- This happened because WebView doesn't support window.Notification

**The Fix:**
- I upgraded your code to use OneSignal SDK v16 (works in WebView)
- I removed the broken notification check
- I configured everything with your App ID

**What's Missing:**
- You need to tell WebIntoApp about OneSignal
- This makes WebIntoApp inject native Android code
- This creates the bridge between JavaScript and Android
- Without this, notifications can't work in the APK

**It's like:**
- I built the car ✅ (code)
- You need to put gas in it ⚠️ (WebIntoApp config)
- Then it will run! 🚀
